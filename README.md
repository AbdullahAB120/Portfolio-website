<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a portfolio website template. When I have completed HTML & CSS, I made this website for practise purpose. I made this website with HTML & CSS. So It is a simple static website, also it is not responsive. But it is a creative work for me. Because this website's GUI was totally my own idea. However, you can contact with me for more information. Thank you for visiting my github repo...!
